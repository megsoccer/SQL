# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1. What artists have the most energy and liveness?
SELECT artist_name, sum((energy)+(liveness)) as energy_liveness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY energy_liveness desc LIMIT 5;

#2. Order the artists by popularity with their track names.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc;

#3. What is the average danceability for the top 10 artists?
SELECT artist_name, avg(danceability), popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc LIMIT 10;

#4. Determine the 15 loudest songs.
SELECT loudness, track_name, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY loudness desc LIMIT 15;

#5. What tracks have the least tempo? limit this to 5.
SELECT tempo, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo asc LIMIT 5;

#6. Which artist has the longest song? and whats the song name?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY Max(duration_ms) LIMIT 1;

#7. What artists show up more than once on the list? 
SELECT artist_name, count(*)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(*)>1;

#8. How many songs feature another artist? 
SELECT count(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name like '%feat.%';
